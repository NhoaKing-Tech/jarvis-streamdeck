## üìã What YOU Need to Do

### Phase 1: Understanding (30 minutes)

**Read these files in order:**

1. **Start here**: `jarvis/git_docs/README.md`
   - Understand what the system does
   - See the big picture

2. **Quick overview**: `jarvis/git_docs/00_OVERVIEW.md`
   - Architecture overview
   - How workflows integrate

3. **Understand Workflow 1**: `jarvis/git_docs/01_WORKFLOW_1_SQUASH_MERGE.md`
   - Learn squash merge (15-20 min read)
   - This is beginner-friendly

4. **Understand Workflow 2**: `jarvis/git_docs/02_WORKFLOW_2_DOCUMENTATION_PIPELINE.md`
   - Learn doc automation
   - See how tags work

**After Phase 1, you'll understand HOW and WHY the system works.**

---

### Phase 2: Implementation (45 minutes)

**Follow this file step-by-step:**

üìñ **`jarvis/git_docs/03_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**

This guide walks you through:
1. Installing the git hook (5 min)
2. Testing doc generation (5 min)
3. Configuring GitHub (10 min)
4. Setting up GitHub Actions (10 min)
5. Performing first squash merge (10 min)
6. Deploying to GitHub Pages (5 min)

**OR use the express version:**

üìñ **`jarvis/git_docs/QUICK_START.md`** (15 minutes total)

---

### Phase 3: Verification (15 minutes)

**Test that everything works:**

```bash
# 1. Test doc extraction
cd /home/nhoaking/Zenith/jarvis-streamdeck
python jarvis/utils/extract_comments.py jarvis/actions/actions.py

# 2. Test doc generation
python jarvis/utils/generate_docs.py jarvis/ --output jarvis/docs/content/

# 3. Check generated docs
ls -R jarvis/docs/content/

# 4. Test git hook
git checkout dev
echo "# EDU: Test comment" >> test_file.py
git add test_file.py
git commit -m "Test pre-commit hook"
# You should see: "‚úÖ Documentation generated successfully"

# 5. Clean up test
git reset --hard HEAD~1
rm test_file.py
```

---

### Phase 4: First Deployment (20 minutes)

**Execute the workflows:**

```bash
# 1. Ensure dev is clean
git checkout dev
git status

# 2. Squash merge to main
git checkout main
git merge --squash dev

# 3. Create commit
git commit -m "Initial release of Jarvis StreamDeck system

Complete implementation with automated documentation pipeline.

Features:
- Custom action system for automation
- Dynamic layout management
- Documentation extraction from code comments
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

Built using Docs-as-Code principles with single-sourcing.

ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code"

# 4. Push to GitHub (triggers deployment)
git push origin main

# 5. Go to GitHub and watch
# Repository ‚Üí Actions tab
# Should see "Deploy Documentation to GitHub Pages" running

# 6. Wait 5 minutes, then visit your site
# https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/jarvis-streamdeck/
```

## üéì Before You Start - Important Notes

### About Comments and Tags

**Your current code needs tags!** The documentation says:

> "I still have to modify the comments to include the tags. Not all of them are classified by tag"

**What this means:**
- Your current extensive comments in files like `jarvis/actions/actions.py` exist
- But they may not all have tags like `#EDU:`, `#NOTE:`, etc.
- The system will only extract **tagged** comments

**Your options:**

**Option A**: Tag your existing comments (recommended)
```python
# Before:
# This is an educational comment about design patterns

# After:
# EDU: This is an educational comment about design patterns
```

**Option B**: Generate docs from what's already tagged
```bash
# See what's currently tagged:
grep -r "#EDU\|#NOTE\|#IMPORTANT" jarvis/*.py

# If you found some, proceed with current state
# Add more tags over time
```

**Option C**: Use the system first, tag later
```bash
# System works fine even with no tagged comments
# You just won't generate much documentation yet
# Add educational tags as you refactor
```

### Suggested Approach

1. **Implement the system first** (Phase 2)
2. **Test with existing tags** (if any)
3. **Gradually add more tags** to your comments over time
4. **Regenerate docs** as you add tags

The system is **non-destructive** - it won't change your existing code.

## üìä Success Criteria

You'll know it worked when:

### Local Success
- [ ] Git hook runs on every commit in dev branch
- [ ] Documentation files appear in `jarvis/docs/content/`
- [ ] Squash merge creates one clean commit on main
- [ ] No errors in terminal output

### GitHub Success
- [ ] Repository pushed to GitHub
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow runs (green checkmark)
- [ ] Pages setting shows "GitHub Actions" as source
- [ ] Site accessible at `https://USERNAME.github.io/jarvis-streamdeck/`

### Documentation Success
- [ ] Site loads and shows index page
- [ ] Navigation works between pages
- [ ] Educational content is formatted properly
- [ ] Updates when you push new commits

---

## üÜò If Something Goes Wrong

### Hook Doesn't Run
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit  # Should show -rwxr-xr-x
```

### Python Errors
```bash
# Check Python version
python3 --version  # Should be 3.7+

# Run scripts manually to see errors
python jarvis/utils/extract_comments.py jarvis/ --recursive
```

### GitHub Actions Fails
1. Check repository Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
2. Enable "Read and write permissions"
3. Check workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`

### Complete Troubleshooting
üìñ Read: `jarvis/git_docs/07_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Read the guides** - They're written for beginners, very detailed
2. **Test scripts manually first** - Before relying on git hook
