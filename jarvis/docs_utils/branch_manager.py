Branch Manager for Dev/Main Workflow

This script helps manage the different .gitignore files and workflows
for the dev (private development) and main (public GitHub) branches.

Commands:
    setup-dev     - Only configures the current branch for development (copies .gitignore-dev to .gitignore) without switching branches
    setup-main    - Only configures the current branch for GitHub deployment (copies .gitignore-main to .gitignore) without switching branches
    status        - Show current branch configuration
    switch-to-dev - First switches to the dev branch (git checkout dev), then calls setup_dev_branch() to apply the development configuration
    switch-to-main- First switches to the main branch (git checkout main) after checking for uncommitted changes, then calls setup_main_branch() to apply the production configuration

The setup-* commands are for configuring your current branch, while switch-to-* commands both change branches AND apply the appropriate configuration. The switch commands are more comprehensive - they handle branch switching plus the configuration that the setup commands provide.

This means that when we want to switch branches, we should use the switch-to-* commands to ensure both the branch and its configuration are correctly set. However, this might fail if there are uncommitted changes, so we should commit or stash changes before switching, to save the progress of the current branch. After that, we can change branches with the switch-to-* commands. When switching branches, any uncommitted changes will be lost if they conflict with the target branch. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that all changes are committed or stashed before executing the switch-to-* commands.

We must consider that when switching branches, the files in the working directory will change to match the target branch. When you switch branches with git checkout main, your working directory files will change to match the last commit on the main branch. The same applies when switching to the dev branch.

In VS Code, you'll see:
- Files that exist in main but not dev will appear
- Files that exist in dev but not main will disappear from the file explorer
- Files that exist in both branches but with different content will show the main branch version
- Any open editor tabs for files that don't exist in main will show as "deleted" or close

This is standard git behavior - your working directory reflects whatever branch you're currently on. The branch_manager.py script adds the .gitignore switching on top of this, so you'll also get different ignore rules. 

That's why the script checks for uncommitted changes before switching to main - if you had unsaved work, it could be lost when the files revert to the main branch state.

If you want to see what differences exist between branches before switching, you can run:

`git diff dev..main`

What is 'stash changes'?

Stashing changes in Git allows you to save your uncommitted changes temporarily without committing them. This is useful when you need to switch branches but aren't ready to commit your current work. You can stash your changes, switch branches, and then apply the stashed changes later.

What git stash does:
- Saves your modified files and staged changes
- Reverts your working directory to the last commit (clean state)
- Stores the changes in a "stash" that you can retrieve later

Common stash commands:
`git stash`              # Save current changes to stash
`git stash pop`          # Restore the most recent stash and remove it from stash list
`git stash apply`        # Restore stash but keep it in the stash list
`git stash list`         # See all your stashes
`git stash drop`         # Delete a stash without applying it

Typical workflow:
1. You're working on dev branch with uncommitted changes
2. You need to quickly switch to main
3. Run git stash - saves your work, cleans working directory
4. Switch to main branch (now allowed since directory is clean)
5. Do your work on main
6. Switch back to dev
7. Run git stash pop - your uncommitted changes are restored

It's basically a temporary save feature that lets you switch contexts without losing work or making premature commits.

print() prints a new line after the mesage by default as always. If we want to avoid that, we can use end="" in the print function. We can specify the separator between multiple items with sep="" in the print function (default is space).

    To avoid newline:
    print(f"üîß {description or command}", end="")  # No newline
    print("Hello", end=" ")  # Ends with space instead

    To print multiple items with custom separator:
    print("apple", "banana", "cherry", sep=", ")  # Output: apple, banana, cherry
    print("2025", "01", "15", sep="-")           # Output: 2025-01-15
    print("Loading", ".", ".", ".", sep="")      # Output: Loading...

    Common parameters:
    - sep="" - What to put between multiple arguments (default is space)
    - end="" - What to put at the end (default is newline)
    - file=sys.stderr - Where to print (default is stdout)

    Examples:
    print("Status:", "Running", sep=" -> ")     # Status -> Running
    print("Progress: ", end="")                 # No newline, next print continues same line
    print("[", "‚ñ†" * 5, "]", sep="")           # [‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†]
    print("Error", "Warning", sep=" | ", end="!\n")  # Error | Warning!

    So if you wanted the original line to not add a newline:
    print(f"{description or command}", end="")  # Print without newline

---
f-strings (formatted string literals) are a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}. They were introduced in Python 3.6 and provide a concise and readable way to format strings. There are so many cool things we can do with f-strings:

Basic syntax:
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
# Output: Hello, Alice! You are 30 years old.

What it does:
- f prefix tells Python this is a formatted string
- {} inside the string are placeholders for expressions
- Python evaluates the expressions and inserts the results

Examples:
x = 10
y = 20
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {x + y}")  # The sum of 10 and 20 is 30

# Can call functions inside
name = "john"
print(f"Hello, {name.title()}!")  # Hello, John!

# Can format numbers. How many decimal places.
price = 19.99
print(f"Price: ${price:.2f}")  # Price: $19.99

In your code:
print(f"üîß {description or command}")
This means: "Print üîß followed by either description (if it exists) or command (if description is empty/None)"

'''
Parameters vs Arguments of a function
Parameters: The variables defined in the function signature or definition. They are placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function when it is called.
Arguments: The actual values or data that are passed to the function when it is called or invoked. These values correspond to the parameters defined in the function signature.
So argument is the name for the actual value we pass to a function, while parameter is the name for the variable in the function definition that receives that value.
We use parameters to refer to the definition of the function, and arguments to refer to the actual values we provide when calling the function.
However, many people use them interchangeably in casual conversation, so the distinction is not always strictly observed.
There are three types of parameters:
1. Positional Parameters: These are the most common type of parameters. When you define a function, you can specify parameters in the function signature. When you call the function, you provide arguments in the same order as the parameters are defined. For example in run_command(command, description="", check=True), command is a positional parameter, because it has no default value and must be provided in the correct order when calling the function.
2. Keyword Parameters (optional when calling the function): These parameters are defined with default values in the function signature. When calling the function, you can specify arguments by naming the parameters explicitly, regardless of their order. For example, in run_command(command, description="", check=True), description and check are keyword parameters with default values.
3. *args and **kwargs: These are special types of parameters that allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. *args collects extra positional arguments as a tuple, while **kwargs collects extra keyword arguments as a dictionary. We do not need to provide default values for these parameters. These are called variable-length argument collectors. *args is variable positional parameters, while **kwargs is variable keyword parameters.
