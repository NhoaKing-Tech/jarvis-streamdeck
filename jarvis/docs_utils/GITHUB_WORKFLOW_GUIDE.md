# 🚀 GitHub Deployment Workflow Guide

*Professional Dev/Main Branch Strategy for Public Repositories*

---

## 🎯 Workflow Overview

### **The Two-Branch Strategy**

- **`dev` branch**: Private development with full annotations and documentation
- **`main` branch**: Public GitHub repository with clean production code only

### **Directory Structure**

```bash
# Code block set to bash only to have some syntax highlight so it reads easier.

'LOCAL REPOSITORY:' # -> TRACKED IN DEV BRANCH, NOT MAIN
|  -- src_dev/ # PRIVATE (dev branch only, local)
│  ----- main.py
│  ----- assets/ folder # TRACKED
│  ----- src/ folders  #TRACKED (code with comments and annotations). src folders classified by concern
│  ----- auto_docs/ # IGNORED: Documentation output from my automated workflow
│  --------- content/ # IGNORED: Generated markdown for Quartz content folder
│  ----- doc/ # TRACKED: Documentation manually created
│  --------- *.md # If needed, I have support documents manually created
│  ----- docs_utils/ # TRACKED: Documentation scripts & workflow guides
│  --------- *.py # Tools to create my docs in markdown automatically
│  --------- *.md # Workflow guides
│  ----- test/ # Test scripts
│  ----- other files
|  -- Other files like .gitignore, README.md, etc.
|  -- forked_folders/ # Other folders if the origin of the repo was forked
|  -- forked_files/ # Other files if the origin of the repo was forked

# The next folder is created from hooks and doc_utils, but this folder is ignored in the dev branch. Includes only clean production code and minimal comments.
|  -- src_prod/ # Codebase stripped of long comments and annotations
│  ----- main.py
│  ----- assets/ folder
│  ----- src/ folders # src folders classified by concern
│  ----- test/

'GITHUB REPOSITORY'
|  -- src_prod/ # Codebase stripped of long comments and annotations
│  ----- main.py
│  ----- assets/ folder
│  ----- src/ folders
│  ----- test/ # Test scripts
│  ----- other files
|  -- Other files like .gitignore, README.md, etc.
|  -- forked_folders/ # Other folders if the origin of the repo was forked
|  -- forked_files/ # Other files if the origin of the repo was forked

# NOTE: src_dev/ directory is IGNORED on main branch
# Only src_prod/ (clean production code) is visible on GitHub. The docs of the repository are not shared directly in the repo, they will be shared via GitHub pages.
```

## 📋 Complete Workflow Steps

### **1. Daily Development (dev branch)**

```bash
# Ensure you're on dev branch
git checkout dev

# Configure for development
cd jarvis/docs
python3 branch_manager.py setup-dev

# Write code with annotations
# DEV: Implementation details
# ARCH: Design decisions
# EDU: Learning notes
# PROD: Critical comments

# Commit your changes (hooks auto-generate docs)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature with comprehensive documentation"
```

### **2. Prepare for GitHub Deployment**

```bash
# From jarvis/docs directory
python3 deploy_to_github.py "feat: Add audio controls for StreamDeck"
```

**This script automatically:**
1. ✅ Generates production build (`jarvis_prod/`)
2. ✅ Switches to `main` branch
3. ✅ **Stages `jarvis_prod/` directory for GitHub deployment**
4. ✅ Creates professional README.md
5. ✅ Commits deployment with proper message (squash merge effect)
6. ✅ Provides push instructions

**Important:** The `jarvis/` development directory is ignored on main branch. GitHub only sees the clean `jarvis_prod/` directory with production-ready code.

### **3. Push to GitHub**

```bash
# Push the clean production code
git push origin main

# Return to development
git checkout dev
```

### **4. Continue Development**

```bash
# Back to development work
git checkout dev

# Your extensive annotations and documentation are preserved
# Continue normal development cycle
```

---

## 🔧 Available Tools

### **Branch Manager**
```bash
cd jarvis/docs

# Activate your conda environment first
conda activate jarvis-busybee

# Check current status
python branch_manager.py status

# Setup branch configurations
python branch_manager.py setup-dev      # For development
python branch_manager.py setup-main     # For GitHub deployment

# Quick branch switching
python branch_manager.py switch-to-dev
python branch_manager.py switch-to-main
```

### **Production Builder**
```bash
# Activate your conda environment first
conda activate jarvis-busybee

# Generate clean production code
python create_production_build.py

# Result: jarvis_prod/ directory with clean code (ready for GitHub)
```

### **Documentation Generator**
```bash
# Activate your conda environment first
conda activate jarvis-busybee

# Generate comprehensive docs from annotations
python quartz_markdown.py

# Result: content/ directory with detailed documentation
```

### **GitHub Deployer**
```bash
# Activate your conda environment first
conda activate jarvis-busybee

# Full deployment workflow
python deploy_to_github.py "Your commit message"

# One command handles everything for GitHub deployment
```

## ⚙️ Git Hooks Behavior

### **Pre-commit Hook (Branch-Aware)**

**On `dev` branch:**
- ✅ Auto-generates documentation when Python files change
- ✅ Stages generated docs for commit
- ✅ Preserves all annotation types

**On `main` branch:**
- ✅ Validates only production files are committed
- ❌ Blocks accidental `jarvis/` directory commits
- ✅ Ensures clean production-only commits

**On other branches:**
- ✅ Basic validation only
- ✅ Flexible for feature development

---

## 📁 .gitignore Strategy

### **Dev Branch (.gitignore-dev)**
```gitignore
# Ignore generated production build
jarvis_prod/

# Ignore personal configs
jarvis/config/config.env
.vscode/settings.json

# Keep all source code and docs
# (jarvis/ directory is tracked)
```

### **Main Branch (.gitignore-main)**
```gitignore
# Ignore private development
jarvis/

# Ignore source of production build
jarvis_prod/

# Only track clean production code
```

---

## 🚨 Important Rules

### **Never Manually Edit Main Branch**
- Main branch is **generated only**
- All changes happen in `dev` branch
- Use `deploy_to_github.py` for all main branch updates

### **Keep Secrets Private**
- `config.env` files never committed
- Personal settings stay in `dev` branch
- Production code has no hardcoded secrets

### **Annotation Discipline**
```python
# PROD: Critical information for production users
# DEV: Implementation details for developers
# ARCH: Design decisions and rationale
# EDU: Learning notes and CS concepts
# Regular comments stay as-is
```

python branch_manager.py switch-to-main
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Commit Message Strategy**
```bash
# Dev branch: Detailed for your reference
git commit -m "refactor: Improve audio factory pattern

- Add comprehensive EDU comments about factory pattern benefits
- Document ARCH decision to support multiple audio backends
- Include DEV notes about O(1) lookup performance optimization"

# Main branch: Professional for public
# (Handled automatically by deploy_to_github.py)
```

### **Branch Naming**
- `dev` - Main development branch
- `main` - GitHub public branch
- `feature/audio-controls` - Feature branches (merge to dev)
- `hotfix/critical-bug` - Emergency fixes

### **Documentation Workflow**
1. Write comprehensive annotations during development
2. Generated docs serve as internal knowledge base
3. GitHub README serves as user-facing documentation
4. Both stay automatically synchronized

## 🎓 Computer Science Deep Dive: Understanding Squash Merge

*A professor's explanation of Git's squash merge feature and why it's essential for professional development*

### 📚 What is a Squash Merge?

A **squash merge** is a Git operation that takes multiple commits from a source branch and combines them into a single commit on the target branch. Think of it as taking a rough draft with many edits and revisions, then creating one final, polished version.

### 🔬 The Computer Science Behind It

#### **Traditional Merge vs Squash Merge:**

**Traditional Merge (preserves all commits):**
```
dev branch:    A---B---C---D
                        \
main branch:   X---Y---Z---M (merge commit)
```
Result: All commits A, B, C, D appear in main branch history

**Squash Merge (combines commits):**
```
dev branch:    A---B---C---D

main branch:   X---Y---Z---S (single squashed commit)
```
Result: Only one commit S appears in main branch (contains all changes from A+B+C+D)

#### **Mathematical Representation:**
If we have commits with changes Δ₁, Δ₂, Δ₃, Δ₄:
- Traditional merge: main = base + Δ₁ + Δ₂ + Δ₃ + Δ₄ (preserves intermediate states)
- Squash merge: main = base + (Δ₁ + Δ₂ + Δ₃ + Δ₄) (only final state)

### 🏭 How Our Deployment Script Implements Squash Merge

Our `deploy_to_github.py` script effectively performs a **manual squash merge**:

1. **Captures the final state** of your dev branch work
2. **Generates clean production code** from your annotated development code
3. **Creates one professional commit** on main branch
4. **Discards intermediate development commits** from GitHub history

#### **The Process Step-by-Step:**

```bash
# Step 1: Multiple development commits (dev branch)
git commit -m "wip: experimenting with audio"
git commit -m "debug: microphone issue"
git commit -m "refactor: better approach"
git commit -m "feat: audio controls complete"

# Step 2: Deploy script performs "squash merge equivalent"
python deploy_to_github.py "feat: Add professional audio system"

# Result: One clean commit on main branch containing all changes
```

#### **What Happens Under the Hood:**

```python
# Pseudo-code of our squash merge implementation:
def deploy_to_github(professional_message):
    # 1. Take final state of dev branch
    dev_final_state = get_current_dev_state()

    # 2. Generate production code (clean annotations)
    production_code = clean_annotations(dev_final_state)

    # 3. Switch to main branch
    checkout("main")

    # 4. Apply ALL changes as ONE commit
    apply_changes(production_code)
    create_commit(professional_message)  # Single commit with all changes

    # 5. Result: GitHub sees one professional commit
```

### 🎯 Professional Benefits

#### **For Your Portfolio:**
- **Clean commit history** shows planning and professionalism
- **Meaningful commit messages** explain features, not process
- **No "debug" or "wip" commits** visible to employers

#### **For Collaboration:**
- **Easier code review** - reviewers see final result, not process
- **Cleaner git log** - easier to understand project evolution
- **Better release notes** - each commit represents a complete feature

#### **For Project Management:**
- **Features map to commits** - one commit = one feature
- **Easier rollbacks** - can revert entire features cleanly
- **Better bisecting** - easier to find when bugs were introduced

### 📊 Example: Before and After

#### **Development History (dev branch - private):**
```
commit abc123: wip: trying different audio approach
commit def456: debug: why is toggle not working?
commit ghi789: experiment: factory vs singleton pattern
commit jkl012: refactor: much cleaner now
commit mno345: fix: edge case in device detection
commit pqr678: feat: audio controls working perfectly
```

#### **GitHub History (main branch - public):**
```
commit xyz999: feat: Add comprehensive audio control system

Implements professional audio management for StreamDeck with:
- Real-time microphone toggle with visual feedback
- Volume control supporting multiple audio backends
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
- Extensible factory pattern for future features

Technical highlights:
- Observer pattern for responsive UI updates
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Complete test coverage and documentation
```

### 🧠 Why This is Superior to Manual Squashing

#### **Traditional Git Squash:**
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~6  # Interactive rebase to squash commits
# Manually edit commit messages
# Risk of conflicts and mistakes
```

#### **Our Automated Approach:**
```bash
python deploy_to_github.py "professional message"
# Automated, safe, consistent
# No risk of git conflicts
# Clean production code generation
# Professional commit formatting
```

## 🔄 Professional Development Cycle: Squash Merge Workflow

*How to maintain messy development commits locally while deploying clean commits to GitHub*

### 📋 The Professional Challenge

You want to:
1. **Commit frequently** during development (messy commits are OK!)
2. **Save progress** without pushing to GitHub
3. **Deploy professionally** with single clean commits
4. **Maintain clean GitHub history** for portfolio/employers

### 🚀 Complete Workflow Example

#### **Phase 1: Private Development (Multiple Commits)**

```bash
# Setup development environment
git checkout dev
conda activate jarvis-busybee
cd jarvis/docs
python branch_manager.py setup-dev

# Work and commit honestly (private commits)
git add .
git commit -m "wip: experimenting with audio factory pattern"

git add .
git commit -m "debug: why is microphone toggle not working?"

git add .
git commit -m "refactor: found much better approach using observer pattern"

git add .
git commit -m "feat: audio controls working perfectly now

- Comprehensive DEV/ARCH/EDU comments added
- All error cases handled
- Ready for production deployment"

# Your dev branch now has detailed development history
git log --oneline -5
# abc123 feat: audio controls working perfectly now
# def456 refactor: found much better approach using observer pattern
# ghi789 debug: why is microphone toggle not working?
# jkl012 wip: experimenting with audio factory pattern
```

#### **Phase 2: Deploy Single Clean Commit to GitHub**

```bash
# Prepare production deployment
conda activate jarvis-busybee
cd jarvis/docs

# Generate production build and docs
python create_production_build.py
python quartz_markdown.py

# Deploy with single professional commit
python deploy_to_github.py "feat: Add comprehensive audio control system

Implements professional audio management for StreamDeck with:
- Real-time microphone toggle with visual feedback
- Volume control supporting multiple audio backends
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
- Extensible factory pattern for future audio features

Technical highlights:
- Observer pattern for responsive UI updates
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Complete test coverage and documentation
- Cross-platform audio backend support"

# Push to GitHub (single commit)
git push origin main

# Return to development
git checkout dev
```

### 📊 Result: Two Different Histories

#### **Dev Branch (Private - Honest Development):**
```
abc123 feat: audio controls working perfectly now
def456 refactor: found much better approach using observer pattern
ghi789 debug: why is microphone toggle not working?
jkl012 wip: experimenting with audio factory pattern
```

#### **Main Branch (GitHub - Professional History):**
```
xyz999 feat: Add comprehensive audio control system
```

### 🎯 Alternative: Manual Squash Control

For more control over the squash process:

```bash
# After development work in dev branch
git checkout main
conda activate jarvis-busybee

# Create production build
cd jarvis/docs
python create_production_build.py

# Manual squash merge (advanced)
git merge --squash dev

# This stages ALL dev changes as one commit
# Edit/review the changes if needed

# Create your professional commit
git commit -m "feat: Add comprehensive audio control system

[Your detailed professional message]"

# Copy production structure and push
python deploy_to_github.py --copy-only  # Hypothetical flag
git push origin main
git checkout dev
```

### 🔧 Daily Development Commands

#### **Development Session:**
```bash
# Start development
conda activate jarvis-busybee
git checkout dev

# Work and commit frequently (no pressure for perfect commits)
git add . && git commit -m "wip: trying approach X"
git add . && git commit -m "fix: handle edge case Y"
git add . && git commit -m "refactor: cleaner implementation"

# When feature is complete and ready
cd jarvis/docs
python deploy_to_github.py "feat: [professional description]"
git push origin main
git checkout dev
```

#### **Emergency: Clean Up Main Branch**
```bash
# If main branch gets messy commits by accident
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main~X  # X = commits to undo
git push --force-with-lease origin main

# Redo deployment properly
conda activate jarvis-busybee
cd jarvis/docs
python deploy_to_github.py "clean professional commit"
git push origin main
```

### 💡 Commit Message Strategy

#### **Development Messages (Private - Be Honest):**
```bash
git commit -m "wip: not sure if this approach will work"
git commit -m "debug: spent 2 hours on this stupid bug"
git commit -m "experiment: trying factory vs singleton"
git commit -m "eureka: finally found the perfect solution!"
```

#### **Production Messages (Public - Be Professional):**
```bash
python deploy_to_github.py "feat: Add robust audio management system

Implements enterprise-grade audio controls with:
- High-performance real-time processing
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements
- Full test coverage and documentation

Performance improvements:
- 40% reduction in audio latency
- Memory usage optimized for long-running sessions
- Thread-safe concurrent audio operations"
```

### 🛡️ Best Practices

#### **Backup Before Major Operations:**
```bash
# Create backup before squashing
git checkout dev
git branch backup-dev-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git checkout main
git branch backup-main-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Now safely proceed with squash operations
```

#### **Branch Hygiene:**
```bash
# Periodically check branch status
python branch_manager.py status

# Clean up old feature branches
git branch -d old-feature-branch

# Keep main conceptually in sync with dev
# (main should represent production state of dev)
```

### 🎓 Professional Skills Demonstrated

This workflow teaches:
- **Industry Git practices** (squash merging)
- **Commit discipline** for different audiences
- **Branch strategy** for solo development
- **Professional presentation** vs honest development
- **Automated deployment** with quality control
