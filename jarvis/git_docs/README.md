## What This System Does

### Problem
You want to:
1. Show clean, professional code on GitHub for your portfolio
2. Keep detailed educational comments for your own learning
3. Auto-generate documentation from those comments
4. Deploy beautiful documentation to GitHub Pages

### Solution
This system provides:
- **Workflow 1**: Squash merge dev â†’ main for clean git history
- **Workflow 2**: Automated documentation extraction from code comments
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions deploys docs automatically
- **Docs-as-Code**: Single-source documentation principles

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Read the Overview
Start with [00_OVERVIEW.md](./00_OVERVIEW.md) to understand the big picture.

### 2. Learn the Workflows
- [01_WORKFLOW_1_SQUASH_MERGE.md](./01_WORKFLOW_1_SQUASH_MERGE.md) - Clean git history
- [02_WORKFLOW_2_DOCUMENTATION_PIPELINE.md](./02_WORKFLOW_2_DOCUMENTATION_PIPELINE.md) - Auto-docs

### 3. Implement the System
Follow [03_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./03_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md) step-by-step.

### 4. Daily Usage
```bash
# Work in dev
git checkout dev

# Make changes, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature"
# (Pre-commit hook auto-generates docs)

# When ready for release
git checkout main
git merge --squash dev
git commit -m "Release v1.0"
git push origin main
# (GitHub Actions auto-deploys docs)
```

â”œâ”€â”€ .git/hooks/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pre-commit            # Auto-runs on commit
â””â”€â”€ .github/workflows/
    â””â”€â”€ deploy-docs.yml       # Auto-deploys to Pages
```

### GitHub Repository
- **Main Branch**: Clean code + auto-generated docs
- **GitHub Pages**: Beautiful documentation site
- **Actions**: Automated deployment

## Key Features

### âœ… Clean Git History
One polished commit instead of dozens of "WIP", "fix typo", etc.

### âœ… Docs-as-Code
Documentation lives in code as comments, auto-extracted to markdown.

### âœ… Single-Sourcing
One source of truth (comments) â†’ multiple outputs (docs, website).

### âœ… CI/CD Automation
- Pre-commit hook: Generates docs automatically
- GitHub Actions: Deploys to Pages automatically

### âœ… Portfolio-Ready
Demonstrates professional practices for technical writing roles.

## For Different Audiences

### Git Beginners
1. Read [01_WORKFLOW_1_SQUASH_MERGE.md](./01_WORKFLOW_1_SQUASH_MERGE.md)
2. Practice squash merge on a test repo first
3. Then implement full system

### Technical Writers
1. Read [02_WORKFLOW_2_DOCUMENTATION_PIPELINE.md](./02_WORKFLOW_2_DOCUMENTATION_PIPELINE.md)
2. Understand Docs-as-Code principles
3. See how it showcases your skills

### Developers
1. Check [08_TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md](./08_TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md)
2. Review Python script APIs
3. Customize for your needs

### Want to Preview Docs Locally?
1. Read [09_QUARTZ_PREVIEW.md](./09_QUARTZ_PREVIEW.md)
2. Set up local Quartz installation
3. Preview before pushing to GitHub

### Hiring Managers
1. Read [00_OVERVIEW.md](./00_OVERVIEW.md)

## Common Questions

### "Why two workflows?"
Workflow 1 (squash merge) creates clean git history. Workflow 2 (doc pipeline) creates beautiful documentation. Together, they create a professional repository perfect for portfolios.

### "Will I lose my commit history?"
No! Dev branch keeps all your commits. Only main has the squashed commits.

### "Can I use this without GitHub Pages?"
Yes! The documentation generation works locally. GitHub Pages deployment is optional.

### "Do I have to use both workflows?"
No. You can use squash merge without doc automation, or doc automation without squash merge. But they're designed to work together.

### "Is this industry standard?"
Squash merge: Yes, very common.
Docs-as-Code: Yes, best practice.
This exact combination: Customized for portfolio/learning.
